Find a [panagram][pan], but with two differences:

1. Use each letter *exactly* once, instead of *at least* once.

2. No grammar restrictions -- it doesn't need to be a sentence.

## Motivation

I was playing with my infant son's blocks. He has 26 of them, one for each
letter. I got to wondering how many words I could spell with those blocks.
Could I use them all?

## Thoughts on dictionary

After looking at some perfect pangrams online it became clear that I didn't want to use a full dictionary. [For example][w]:

    Cwm fjord veg balks nth pyx quiz.

Sure it's a perfect pangram, but it won't impress anybody because it looks like a monkey typed it out.

My solution was to restrict my search to commonly used words.

## Results

My best results after using the 10,000 most commonly used words found in all [Project Gutenberg][pg] books:
